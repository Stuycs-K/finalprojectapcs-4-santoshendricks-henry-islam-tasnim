### 2025-05-16
We made our proposals for Smash Bros, Flappy Bird, and Diep.io

### 2025-05-19
Brainstormed prototype for Diep.io, and planned out all the different features we would incorporate from Diep

### 2025-05-20
Continued Brainstorming and adding features and then drafted initial UML draft for submission

### 2025-05-21
Wrote first draft of proposal and first draft of UML for submission

### 2025-05-26 
Starting on FieldObject and New Commnds that would generally be used for all of the field objects such as grabbing positions and manipulating velocity. Tried to implement PVectors and more Processing oriented syntax.

### 2024-05-27
Revisiing the UML based off of advice given and adding in more details to how the entire game system will be handled. 

### 2024-05-28
Started implementing the variables and functions for the Player and Polgon. Learnt about the translate function so as to figure out how to make the map of the game.

### 2024-05-29
Made the Main Menu as a starting screen.  Started researching how to do non circular collisions and got stuck. Developed the Diep class to be able to separate the starting state and the game state

### 2024-05-30
Researched into how to do non-circular collisions and stumbled upon separating axis theorem.

### 2024-05-31
Learnt about Matrixes and how they are a superior method to purely the transform function since the matrix shifts the axis themselves.

### 2024-06-01
Abandoned the non-circular collisions after learning that Diep.io also ran into the same issue. Made the bullet collision object removal
